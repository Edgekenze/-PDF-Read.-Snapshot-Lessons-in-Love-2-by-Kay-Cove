Lean in. Take your seat at the head of the table. I want the whole room to know that when my wife speaks, it?s time to sit down and listen.Thanks to my reckless roommate, I?m about two skips away from being homeless. Temp jobs aren?t paying the bills, and now I have to cancel the scuba diving trip I can no longer afford.At least I?ll be spared from my instructor?s tempting smile and rock-hard abs. Dex is wonderful, but he?s only ever treated me like a friend?a really good friend. In fact, when he hears I?m having money problems, he comes up with a way we can help each other.In a clever scheme to ensure her jaded, love-doubting grandson didn?t end up alone, Dex?s grandma left her company to Dex?s?wife. Except he isn?t married. Until me, </p>
